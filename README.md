# Godot 4 Simple Game Example - Touch the Blue Box

This repository contains a simple game example developed in Godot 4, demonstrating the use of a game manager to handle loadable levels and manage the game lifecycle. The project is designed to help you understand the basic structure of a Godot game with multiple levels and state management.

## Features

- **Game**: Manages the overall game state, including transitions between different levels. Game state handles the transitions from the start screen, through gameplay, to the end game conditions.
- **Levels**: Each level is designed as a separate scene, allowing for clean management and easy level loading.
